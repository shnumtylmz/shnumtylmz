#                       Greetings ðŸ‘‹ I'm Åžahin Umut YÄ±lmaz
 I am a recent graduate from the Journalism Department of Anadolu University. During the pandemic, I took the opportunity to expand my skill set by learning HTML and CSS, laying the foundation for my journey into web development. My passion for storytelling, combined with my new technical skills, has ignited a desire to further develop my expertise in the digital realm.

I am eager to delve deeper into the world of web development, starting with JavaScript to enhance the interactivity of my projects. Additionally, I plan to explore popular frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js, which are essential for building dynamic and responsive web applications.
